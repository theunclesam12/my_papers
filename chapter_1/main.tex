% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} paper improves upon past methods of low-light semantic segmentation by improving upon preexisting models. Current models

paper addresses [short problem description]. Motivation: explain why the problem matters in practice and research. Provide a succinct statement of challenges (e.g., occlusion, domain shift, limited annotations).
These people are crazyyyy: \cite{weiDeepRetinexDecomposition2018}

Sooo what does the paper address?
- We are investigating low-light semantic segmentation.

Why is this important?
- Particularly for autonomous driving, low-light conditions are common and challenging for perception systems. Due to financial constraints, it is not always possible to equip vehicles with high-end sensors that perform well in low-light. Therefore, improving low-light semantic segmentation using standard cameras is crucial for safety and reliability.
- Cameras serve a huge range of purposes on autonomous vehicles. They are used for object detection, lane detection, traffic sign recognition, and more. Semantic segmentation is an important task that massively assists the vehicle in understanding its surroundings and making informed safe decisions.

How do we address the problem?
- Existing works either focus on supervised or unsupervised methods. Unsupervised methods tend to underperform supervised ones due to the lack of labeled data. However, obtaining labeled data for low-light conditions is expensive and time-consuming.
- Thus in this paper, we investigate supervised methods as they tend to perform better.
- We propose a novel architecture with a novel training strategy to improve low-light semantic segmentation performance on standard benchmarks, such as NightCity, ACDC, and Dark Zurich.
- This architecture hones in on the concept of hard regions within images. We hypothesise that what differentiates the low-light and normal-light images are the hard regions. Hard regions are areas within images that are particularly challenging to segment, such as areas with poor illumination, high noise, or complex textures. By focusing on these hard regions during training, we can improve the model's ability to handle low-light conditions effectively. Presently, NightLab \cite{dengNightLabDualLevelArchitecture2022} and InforMS \cite{wangInformativeClassesMatter2023} have explored similar ideas, but NightLab focuses on running two separate branches for easy and hard parts of the image, whilst InforMS focuses on varying the frequency of classes during training based on IoU performance.
- Unlike existing works, we determine hard regions dynamically during training based on the performance of the model. We introduce a hard-region enhancement module that identifies and enhances these challenging areas, by applying

\end{itemize}

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}
\subsection{Overview}
\begin{figure*}[!t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Methodology/training.png}
    \caption{Training overview of the proposed method. The hard-region enhancement module identifies and enhances challenging areas in low-light images, which are then processed by the segmentation backbone to produce accurate semantic segmentation maps.}
    \label{fig:training_overview}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Model architecture}

Currently still in testing, but the model can be in two possibles ways:
1. Train DLV3+ on night images until satisfied. Then in the second stage, use DLV3+'s output to train the hard region enhancement module to identify and enhance harder regions. DLV3+ is either frozen or not frozen during this stage.
2. Train DLV3+ and hard region enhancement module end-to-end from the start. The hard region enhancement module identifies hard regions based on DLV3+'s performance during training, and enhances them dynamically.
2a. This way is a bit sus because the hard region enhancement module may not have a good idea of what hard regions are at the start of training.

The essence of the model is the LLIE module is trained to identify hard regions by simultaneously training a hard region segmentation head that predicts a hard region mask based on an error map generated from the downstream segmentation network. This guides the decoder to learn to extract hard regions from the image and this is used to guide the LLIE head to focus on enhancing these regions.

% Describe backbone, heads, any novel blocks, with layer sizes if relevant.

\subsection{Loss functions}
% Primary loss, auxiliary terms, weighting, and rationale.
The primary loss used is the cross-entropy loss. The cross-entropy loss is given as:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{CE} = - \sum_{n=1}^{N} t_n \log(\hat{y}_n),
\end{equation}
where \(N\) is the number of classes, \(t_n\) is the ground truth label for class \(n\), and \(\hat{y}_n\) is the predicted probability for class \(n\).

To guide the binary segmentation head, a combination of the cross-entropy loss and focal loss is used. The focal loss helps to address class imbalance by focusing more on hard-to-classify examples, which is particularly useful for the hard region segmentation task.
The focal loss is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{Focal} = - \sum_{n=1}^{N} \alpha (1 - \hat{y}_n)^\gamma t_n \log(\hat{y}_n),
\end{equation}
where \(\alpha\) is a balancing factor and \(\gamma\) is the focusing parameter.

Finally, for the LLIE module, it receives supervision from the cross-entropy loss computed on the final segmentation output and a weighted combination of the Structural Similarity Index Measure or SSIM \cite {wangImageQualityAssessment2004} and image enhancement losses from Zero-DCE \cite{guoZeroReferenceDeepCurve2020,liLearningEnhanceLowLight2021}.

Following NightLab's \cite{dengNightLabDualLevelArchitecture2022} approach to training the enhancement module, the SSIM loss is utilised to guide the enhancement and penalise structural distortions. The SSIM loss is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{SSIM} = 1 - SSIM(I_{enhanced}, I_{original}),
\end{equation}
where \(I_{enhanced}\) is the enhanced image output from the LLIE module and \(I_{original}\) is the original image. SSIM is obtained through:
\begin{equation}
    SSIM(x, y) = \frac{(2\mu_x \mu_y + C_1)(2\sigma_{xy} + C_2)}{(\mu_x^2 + \mu_y^2 + C_1)(\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 + C_2)},
\end{equation}
where
